# IGAOD

  IGAOD is an open source interactive genetic algorithm design framework that provides the basic IGA process framework and genetic libraries, including selection, crossover, and mutation operators, to help researchers follow the IGA build process. It provides 3D visualization instances to help users quickly build IGA instances, and provides an algorithm parameter and operator adjustment interface to help them optimize the algorithm.
